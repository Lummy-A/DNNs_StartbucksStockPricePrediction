# Building Deep Neural Networks for Starbucks Stock Open Price Prediction
In this project, we built and leveraged Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to predict the daily opening stock price of Starbucks. By utilizing historical stock price data from 2017 to 2025, we aim to provide accurate stock price predictions to support financial analysis and decision-making.

## Introduction

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of financial markets. In this project we built, trained, hypertuned, and then trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to predict Starbucks' daily opening stock prices using a historical Starbucks dataset. We employed data preprocessing techniques, model optimization, and performance evaluation to achieve the best possible predictions.

## Project Workflow

The workflow of this project is as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Loaded and inspected historical stock price data from 2017 to 2025.
   - Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and distribution.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
   - Carried out feature engineering
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Designed and implemented 4 Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Carried out hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Trained the untuned and tuned DNNs using the preprocessed dataset.
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
   - Visualised the training and validation loss

5. **Results Visualization**:
   - Visualized the model's predictions compared to the actual stock prices.
   - Generated plots to interpret the model's accuracy and performance.
